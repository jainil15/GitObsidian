Waterfall is idea that each phase is started after another phase is completed.

Waterfall needs to be iterative.

# Agile Manifesto 

Individuals and Interactions
Working software
Customer collaboration
Responding to Change


Processes and tools
Comprehensive documentation
Contract negotiation
Following a plan

In Plan driven model we deliver one software
Sequential activity
Changes are discouraged
Plan determine success or failure
I am done when my part is done
Lots of gated sequences to control quality
Inspect when the work is done
Team can predict what will be delivered

In Agile we deliver small changes on the software
Do all the little bit of activity all the time.
Changes are embraced
Customer satisfaction and ROI determines the success incentives.
I am done when the customer is happy
Highly iterative to achieve quality
Work is inspected along the way
Start with a goal of filling a need.

High Business Value early
High Risk at first

Iterative delivery
Frequent feedback
Transparency and openness
Lean principles.

Two Parts of Agile discussion

| **Process and Methodologies** | **Techniques and Practices** |
| ---- | ---- |
| ***Working with People***<br>- Planning<br>- Teamwork<br>- Engaging customers<br>- Providing leadership<br>- Collaboration<br>- Learning | ***Working with software***<br>- Design<br>- Coding<br>- Testing<br>- Deploying<br>- User Experience |

Agile is iterative, adaptive, value based, Easy to understand, Hard to implement

Agile is not writing code, undisciplined, unstructured, whatever you want it to be, it is not placebo for pesky developers.

### XP - Extreme Programming

1. Code Reviews | Pair Programming
2. Testing | TDD and constant regression
3. Software Design | Relentless refactoring
4. Simplicity | The simplest thing that could work
5. Integration testing | continuous integration 
6. Short iterations | Shortest Iteration Planning Game


Collective ownership
40hr work week

### Scrum

An iterative project management process
Blends well with XP
Smile
Used beyond Software development

Scrum has product backlog, spring backlog, 2-4 week sprint 24 hour iteration -> Fully Functional product.
Product backlog is list of requirement this list is prioritized and estimates 
Highest priority item is broken into smaller task this list of task is called spring backlog.
Sprint is iteration 24 hr iteration.


### Lean
### Feature Driven Development
Develop
Build feature list
Plan by feature
Design feature
Build feature

Feature teams


## Creating Effective Requirements

What is requirement
A feature, behavior or constant to be added to the system.
A prelude of conversation
A request for someone to do work
A request for software to change.

 Requirement is not a design, decision, source of truth, illustrative

Independent
Negotiable
Valuable to customer, user
Estimate
Sized Appropriately
Testable

User Stories is simply a way to express requirements
Format: As a `<role>` I want `<feature>` so that `<benefit>`

Use many types of roles in the User Stories

Provides simplicity
All the detail is not recorded in user stories
Detail as smaller sub stories


## Estimating Work

To plan and proceed deliberately 
to get a feel for cost
To calculate potential ROI
To understand the size of something
To know if work even can be done
To weigh options

Bad Ways to estimate software
- Give it to a manager
- Ask a expert
- Without bothering the developers

How to measure
Lines of code
Buckets per day
Cycles per month

Unit of work ;----
### Story Points
Very common way to estimate work
Based on size and complexity
Unitless and numerical relative
Different for each estimation teams
Points are additive 
Easy to understand

***Estimates are not Promises***

### Planning Poker
- ***Estimating is groups are more accurate***

- Uses Relative Estimation

- It is easy
We can get fairly accurate in less amount of time and gives less return over time
Everyone gets to be heard

Each estimator has deck of card
 Customer/Product owner reads story and its discussed briefly
 Each estimator  selects card that's his or her estimate
 Cards are turned over so all can see them *Synchronously*
 Discuss differences
 Re-estimate until estimates converge

Least concerned and most concerned need to state their case to the team

Further rounds needs to converge

- Options for handling conflict wait for convergence, Average the estimates -> Bad, Toss out high and low -> Bad, Send item back for redefinition
