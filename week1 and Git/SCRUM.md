#### Origins of Scrum

	**Scrum promotes**
- small working team
- Embracing change requirement 
- Deliver finished work frequently
- Small batches
- Enabling releasing product whenever required

Activities are time boxed
All projects metrics, reports and deadlines are prominently displayed
Multi-disciplinary and self organizing teams
No specific engineering practices prescribed

Scrum team progresses in sprints
Requirements are captured in items in a product backlog
Continuously test product as it is created

### Scrum Framework
- A project Management technique
- it is agile
- An effective wat of deliver products

1. Schedule a demo with the customer 
2. Make product to show at demo
3. Get feedback  from the customer

### Scrum Team
The fundamental unit of Scrum is a small team of people, a Scrum Team, it consists of one scrum master, one product Owner and Developers.

There are no sub-teams or hierarchies

10 of fewer people in one scum team

The Scrum Team is responsible for all product-related activities from stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything else that might be required

The entire Scrum Team is accountable for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint.

- Developers are people in the scrum team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable increment each sprint
- Accountable for -> Creating plan, the sprint backlog, quality, sprint goal, and holding each other accountable as professionals

- Product owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the product result from the work of the scrum team.
- Accountable for effective backlog management , developing product goal,  communicating product backlog items, ordering product backlog items and ensuring that the product backlog is transparent, visible and understood.

- Scrum master is accountable for establishing scrum as defined in the scrum guide.
- The scrum master is accountable for the effectiveness of the scrum team.
- Scrum master coaches the team members in self management and cross functionality;
- Helping the scrum team high value increments that meet definition of done 

### Product backlog
A prioritized complete list of req.
All potential features of the products
The single source of truth for requirements
Managed by product owner.

Items in product backlog
- Features
- Constraints
- User action or stories
- Behaviors
- Bug / Defects
- Use cases
- Desirement
- Training events

Characteristics of product backlog items 
Unit of deliverable work
Has measurable business value
estimated by the team
May reference other artifacts

### Spring backlog
- Created by the scrum team
- Drawn from the product backlog items
- List of activities the team commits to for a single sprint
- Often thought of as a to-do list for the team.

Single deliverable or activity delivered in a single sprint
Estimated in hours
Managed by a single scrum team member
No min size
ideally 2 days of work

Individuals sign up for work of their own choosing
Estimated work remaining is updated daily
Any team member can add, delete or change the sprint backlog
Work for the sprint emerges

### Spring Burndown Chart
- Shows work remaining for the sprint
- Updated daily
- Used by team members to adjust activities
- Used by scum master as the tactical project management tool.

### Scrum velocity
A measure of how much value a team delivers
Effective plan delivery dates and future works
Will vary from one sprint to another,

## Ceremonies
- The sprint planning meeting
	- Goals are created and agreed to team
- Sprint on Monday
- Time boxed
- Team selects items

***DAILY SCRUMS***

***SPRINT REVIEW***
- Informal

***Sprint retrospective***


## Activities
- Product backlog planning
- The Sprint `No change in sprint`

## Agile Planning
- Plan constantly
- Planning is activity  not a document
- Encourages changes
- Transparent
- Prediction based on the history
- Changing the plan does't change the release date

Daily plan -> Iteration Plan -> release Plan -> Product map -> Product strategy -> Business strategy -> company vision

Daily Plan -> Iteration / Sprint Backlog -> Product Backlog -> Production release Plan.

#### Planning Release
- Date Target Planning
- Feature Target Planning
