## 3 Stages of GIT Lifecycle_
1. **Working Directory** is in which your code resides. Choose files need to be traked 
2. **Staging Area** Choose which files that are to be commit.
3. **Commit** All the files have new commit id attached and saved. `git commit`.


`git init` -> `git add` -> `git commit`

How to get your file back? ..... GITHUB.
-> `git push`

## How it actually works -
Any file stored is used using commit and each commit assigned a unique id through which it can save itself and accessed.
Pointer of the head of the branch points to the latest commit.

Default Branch is called master branch

Create a new branch to a feature.

`git clone`

git fetch vs git pull
