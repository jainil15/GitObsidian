In organizations often face the decision of whether to adopt and maintain different versions of operating systems (OS) within their infrastructure. Following are the reasons an organization might use different versions of OS.
- **Legacy Software Compatibility:**
    - One of the primary reasons organizations maintain different OS versions is to ensure compatibility with legacy software. Some applications or systems may be designed to work optimally on older OS versions, and upgrading to a new OS could render these applications obsolete or malfunctioning.
- **Hardware Constraints:**
    - Older hardware may not support the latest OS versions due to resource limitations. Maintaining a mix of OS versions allows organizations to utilize existing hardware infrastructure without incurring the cost of upgrading all components simultaneously.
- **Transition Periods:**
    - During the transition from one OS version to another, organizations might run multiple versions simultaneously to facilitate a smooth migration process. This phased approach minimizes disruptions and allows for thorough testing before a complete transition
