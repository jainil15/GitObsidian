**1. Local Area Network (LAN):** A Local Area Network, or LAN, is a network that spans a relatively small physical area, such as a home, office, or campus. LANs connect devices like computers, printers, and servers, allowing seamless sharing of resources and data.

**2. Wide Area Network (WAN):** WANs cover larger geographical areas and are typically used to connect LANs separated by great distances. The internet is the most prominent example of a global WAN. WANs employ technologies like routers and leased lines for long-distance data transmission.

**3. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN):** A Metropolitan Area Network, or MAN, bridges the gap between LANs and WANs. It covers a city or a large campus, facilitating high-speed data transfer between multiple locations within the same metropolitan area.

**4. Virtual Private Network (VPN):** VPNs are a secure way to extend a private network across a public network, usually the internet. They provide encrypted connections, allowing users to access data and resources from remote locations securely.

**5. Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN or Wi-Fi):** WLANs use wireless technology to connect devices within a specific area. Wi-Fi networks are commonly found in homes, cafes, and offices, providing users with the convenience of wireless connectivity.
